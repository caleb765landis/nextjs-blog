# Next.js Blog App
This is a simple blog app I wrote to learn Next.js.  
The tutorial I followed is at: [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn).  

The app is hosted by Vercel at [this link](https://nextjs-blog-caleb765landis.vercel.app/).
If running locally, Node.js must be installed. The app can be ran through the following commands:

- npm install
    - Installs all necessary packages to run this app.

- npm run dev  
    - Starts the development server.

- npm run build  
    - Builds the app for production.

- npm start  
    - Runs the built app in production mode.

- npx create-next-app@latest nextjs-blog --use-npm --example "https://github.com/vercel/next-learn/tree/master/basics/learn-starter"  
    - Create a Next.js app of your own using starter template.
